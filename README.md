# Polymer Property Prediction Using Machine Learning
Polymers are large molecules made up of repeating units called monomers. They have a wide application spectrum ranging from electricity to storing of energy. Different applications are dependent on specific polymer properties and prediction of these properties can be challenging and time consuming. By using Machine Learning models and algorithms, one can predict the property value of polymers. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as in the development of new materials. Here, we have compared the prediction of two polymeric properties: 'crystallization energy' and 'chain band width' with four different ML-Models, using two predefined molecular descriptors and proposed an algorithm inspired from extended connectivity fingerprint. The evaluation was carried out using RMSE as a metric for each model and three different fingerprints. It was found out that all the predictions are in range of an approximation of 25% error value while after doing cross validation this value decreases below 5% in range.
