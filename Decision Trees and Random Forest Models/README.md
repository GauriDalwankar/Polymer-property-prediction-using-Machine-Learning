# Decision Tree and Random Forest
Here, we have compared the prediction of two polymeric properties: 'crystallization energy' and 'chain band width' using Decision Tree and Random forest models, using two predefined molecular descriptors (Mordred and RDKIT)and proposed an algorithm inspired from extended connectivity fingerprint. The evaluation was carried out using RMSE as a metric for each model and three different fingerprints.
