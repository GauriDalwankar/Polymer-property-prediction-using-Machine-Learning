# Dataset 
The data for this project has been extracted from paper “A polymer dataset for accelerated property prediction and design”(cite). The polymer dataset is a csv file which includes 6266 data points. It contains  eight properties for each polymer material. The eight properties listed for every polymer material are: Ionization energy (eV), chain bandgap(eV), bulk bandgap (eV), electron affinity (eV), crystallization tendency (%), atomization energy (eV atom -1), dielectric constant and refractive index . The polymers are in the SMILES format which were then later transformed using molecular descriptors  using a method called “Fingerprinting”. The fingerprinting was carried out using three different methods which are : Rd-kit, mordred and our own algorithm based on the idea of Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs).
